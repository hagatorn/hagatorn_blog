Hagatorn is the shopfront for the creative work of myself, Craig Chamberlain.  It is my ambition to design and make satisfying products, that beg to be touched, cherished and understood.

> Hagatorn is Anglo-Saxon for Hawthorn a plant also known as the Ladiesâ€™ Meat or the Bread & Cheese Tree.

As the root of the name may suggest, Hagatorn has one foot in the past, in folklore and in the archaic.  For me the important challange is how to bring this rich nostalgia, symbolism and love of materials into a product that is truely practical in both construction and use.
