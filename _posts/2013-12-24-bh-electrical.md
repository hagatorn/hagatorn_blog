Local electrician, Ben Horlacher, worked with me to design a logo, signage and stationary for his business BH Electrical.

The brief was to design an abstract and eye catching logo to communicate his eye for detail and professionalism.  Most attention was applied to the colour combinations and to minute alterations to the text.
