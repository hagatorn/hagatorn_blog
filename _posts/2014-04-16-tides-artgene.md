It is my pleasure to announce that some of my recent work is currently exhibited with <a href="http://www.art-gene.co.uk/" target="_blank">artgene</a> at the beautiful Nan Tait Centre in Barrow, a contemporary art association in the Furness Peninsula.

Should you be interested in hearing more I have attached a poster and also included its text below.

<blockquote>"Craig Chamberlain is an artist and designer heavily engaged with materiality and craft; making and doing. Simultaneously, his practice is intellectual, broaching academic questions about how we choose to orientate ourselves within the cosmos and in time.

The work included in this exhibition has been generated over a number of years. It chronicles Chamberlain's search for a method to make solid and permanent the restless and ever-changing waveforms found in nature, particularly in and around water.

Enquiries into the particular mechanisms that drive the tides, and the action and the relationships of the sun and the moon have become a central concern. The artist is currently researching Newtonian action at a distance and Luna computation, drawing on the work of earlier tide watcher and calendar reformer; the Venerable St. Bede."</blockquote>
